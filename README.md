# MultiscalePolito

Final pjoject of the Ph.D. course "Multiscale Modeling" held by Matteo Icardi (https://github.com/matteoicardi) at Politecnico di Torino in spring 2020.

## Description

The project aims  to develop simple tools to statistically characterize random heterogeneous solid materials, such as porous media, using fist principal stochastic methods.
